###Usage

Once installed, Steam-AutoCraft adds a new button labeled *"AutoCraft all badges"* to the Steam badges page & *"Auto Craft badges"* to the gamecard page. When activated, the script crafts the available badge, refreshes the page, and checks for another badge to craft until all trading cards are used. Activation from the badges page will craft ALL available badges for ALL possible games.

The following settings are available by clicking the *"âš™"* button: Page Refresh Timeout, Card Refresh Timeout, and Game ID Blacklist. Page and Card refresh values both use the milliseconds metric. The Page refresh occurs after all badges have been crafted and is longer than the Card refresh. The card refresh occurs after a single badge as been crafted. The Game ID Blacklist value uses the format of id1,id2, i.e. 12345,67890. Any ID in the list will be excluded from automatic crafting when recursive mode is executed from the badges page.
